statistical evaluation of particle traces in detectors
______________________________________________________

This program was used in the paper https://www.junge-wissenschaft.ptb.de/fileadmin/paper/bis_2017/pdf/juwi-97-2013-05.pdf primarily for some statistical analyses of particle traces in solid state detectors. 

The file is based on ROOT (using C) and allows the dosimetric characterization of protons given some data input files for numerical eccentricities.
